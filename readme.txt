Presi
=====

Presi is a prototypical implementation of a web application that synchronises a slideshow presentation between different clients. It is based on Node.js in conjunction with Socket.IO to realise inter-browser communication. It uses jQMultiTouch for touch/gesture event handling and adaptation of the layout according to the orientation of the mobile device.

Installation
------------
1. Download and install Node.js (http://nodejs.org)
2. `cd presi`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start` (Later, this is sufficient to start the server)
5. http://localhost:8080/ (Make sure that the port is not used by other services and applications, e.g. Apache Tomcat)
